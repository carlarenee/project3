# MeteorBuddy

MeteorBuddy is an interactive search tool to locate meteorite landings near you! A guest user can enter their location and meteor buddy will show a map of nearby landings. The user can also filter their search by specifying the size and date range of the landing. MeteorBuddy will also render pictures and descriptions of comparable real world examples of the meteorite, i.e. if the meteorite was 10lbs, meteor buddy will show a 10 lb bowling ball. 

MeteorBuddy has 2 models: Users can login, search and save search. Guests can search, but not save their searches.
